     <h2>Rule Of Third</h2>
    <img class="rule" src ="/images/rot.1.png" alt="eiffel towel screenshot"> 
    <p>My example is from a screenshot of the Eiffel Towel.<br> 
        It can be seen that the screeshot of the website is busy. <br> 
        However, with the rule of third in mind, the aim is two things, the Eiffel Towel and the 13 years.</p>

    <h2>Balance</h2>
    <img class="balance" src ="/images/bal.png" alt="kite experience website screenshot"> 
    <p>The example of the balance design is from a water skying website where the photo is centered<br>
    Also, the content and the label are right underneath the photo making it easy to understand and balance.</p>

    <h2>Repetition</h2>
    <img class="repetition" src ="/images/rept.png" alt="shopping website target screenshot"> 
    <p>Target is aiming the towels in this page. It can be seen that there is a repetition of color and different type of towels. <br>
    The display is towels; therefore, there is repetition on the website to point out this specific object.</p>
